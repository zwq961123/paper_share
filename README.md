摘要：Many behavioural interactions in real life involve three individuals. When each individual has two alternative strategies, they can be abstracted into mathematical models by means of 2×2×2 asymmetric games. In this paper, we explore a special class of 2×2×2 asymmetric games satisfying fixed conditions. Firstly, we analyse two solitary interior equilibrium points and provide the judgement condition for their instability based on the Jacobi matrix local stability analysis method. Secondly, we analyse the interior equilibrium points that are continuously distributed within a line and probe into their stability conditions based on generalized Hamiltonian systems theory. Under the circumstances, the stable interior equilibrium point is surrounded by closed orbits in phase space, which presents an observable stable state where two strategies coexist and fluctuate in each of the three game populations. This work enriches the study of 2×2×2 asymmetric games’ evolutionary dynamics.

摘要：In this work, we have studied the evolution of the cooperation and the global synchronization on the Kuramoto model upon random networks with two games, in which one is the evolutionary Kuramoto dilemma and the other is the weak prisoner's dilemma. Agents can gain their payoffs from these two games synchronously. In the evolutionary Kuramoto game, cooperators prefer the formation of local synchronization but pay less cooperative cost. Cooperators in weak prisoner's dilemma can form cooperator clusters because of the network reciprocity. Combining these two games shows a mutual promotion effect upon the order of the global synchronization but a competition effect on the cooperation level. The global synchronization begins to rise only when most agents choose cooperation. It is manifested by the fact that the optimal coupling strength for the highest cooperation level is smaller than that for the highest synchronization level. The high cooperation cost makes defection the most advantageous strategy when the coupling strength reaches rather high, which diminishes the effect of cooperator clusters, and ultimately results in the absence of both cooperators and global synchronization. When agents have more neighbors in the random network, it is observed that cooperation is consistently hindered unless the coupling strength is relatively small. Additionally, there is always an optimal average degree that allows for global synchronization.

摘要：Individual reputation significantly influences players’ decision-making. Players tend to disconnect from neighbors with lower reputations so as to mitigate potential losses in the game. Therefore, it is crucial and meaningful to explore how to apply reputation in the game to enhance cooperation. In this study, we propose a reputation-based evolution mechanism in the Prisoner's Dilemma Game (PDG) within dynamic complex networks, including square lattices and small-world networks. We introduce the reputation factor α and the selection intensity σ in order to measure the changes in reputation and their impact objectively. Moreover, considering the impact of information connectivity, we define the environmental degree r and investigate the effects of environmental degree r and rewiring probability p on cooperation rates. Simulation results demonstrate that the reputation factor and information connectivity have a positive promoting effect on cooperative behavior; conversely, the increase in selection intensity affects cooperation negatively.

摘要：Dynamic environments shape diverse dynamics in evolutionary game systems. We introduce spatial heterogeneity of resources into the Prisoner's Dilemma Game model to explore the co-evolution of individuals' strategies and environmental resources. The adequacy of resources significantly affects the survival competitiveness of surrounding individuals. Feedback between individuals' strategies and the resources they can use leads to the dynamic of the "oscillatory tragedy of the commons". Our findings indicate that when the influence of individuals' strategies on the update rate of resources is significantly high, individuals can form sustained spatial clustered patterns. These sustained patterns can directly trigger a transition in the system from the persistent periodic oscillating state to an equilibrium state. These findings align with observed phenomena in real ecosystems, where organisms organize their spatial structures to maintain system stability. We discuss critical phenomena in detail, demonstrating that the aforementioned phase transition is robust across various system parameters including: the strength of cooperators in restoring the environment, the initial distributions of cooperators, and noise.

摘要：Research on reputation-based indirect reciprocity has found profound achievements, elucidating its role in promoting cooperation over selfish actions. However, some evaluation methodologies have limitations, such as the image scoring model, a classic first-order paradigm. Several studies have suggested that higher-order rules with more individual information can enhance the stability of cooperation. In this study, we introduce a reputation incentive mechanism to explore the cooperative differences among various evaluation rules. Specifically, players evaluate their opponents' actions following first-order and second-order evaluation rules, respectively. Given that players possess varying degrees of social influence, the evaluative intensity is influenced by the neighbor environment and updated in each round. This resultant fluctuations in reputation exhibit heterogeneity and dynamism. Numerical simulations based on the spatial prisoner's dilemma game demonstrate that under stringent conditions, the first-order rule can sustain cooperation, while the second-order rule may fail, leading to complete group defection. Under more relaxed conditions, the second-order rule proves more effective in promoting full cooperation than the first-order rule. Our research contributes to understanding the guidance and influence of reputation on collective behavior.

摘要：The inherent huge complexities in human beings show a remarkable diversity in response to complex surroundings, enabling us to tackle problems from different perspectives. In the realm of cooperation studies, however, existing work assumes that individuals get access to the same kind of information to make their decisions, in contrast to the facts that individuals often perceive differently. Here, within the reinforcement learning framework, we investigate the impact of information perception on the evolution of cooperation in a 2-person scenario when playing the prisoner's dilemma game. We demonstrate that distinctly different evolution processes are observed in three information perception scenarios, revealing that the structure of information significantly affects the emergence of cooperation. Notably, the asymmetric information scenario exhibits a rich dynamical process, including the cooperation emergence, breakdown, and reconstruction, akin to psychological changes in humans. Our findings indicate that the information structure is vital to the emergence of cooperation, shedding new light on establishing mutually stable cooperative relationships and understanding human behavioral complexities in general.

摘要：Recent paradigm shifts from imitation learning to reinforcement learning (RL) is shown to be productive in understanding human behaviors. In the RL paradigm, individuals search for optimal strategies through interaction with the environment to make decisions. This implies that gathering, processing, and utilizing information from their surroundings are crucial. However, existing studies typically study pairwise games such as the prisoners' dilemma and employ a self-regarding setup, where individuals play against one opponent based solely on their own strategies, neglecting the environmental information. In this work, we investigate the evolution of cooperation with the multiplayer game -- the public goods game using the Q-learning algorithm by leveraging the environmental information. Specifically, the decision-making of players is based upon the cooperation information in their neighborhood. Our results show that cooperation is more likely to emerge compared to the case of imitation learning by using Fermi rule. Of particular interest is the observation of an anomalous non-monotonic dependence which is revealed when voluntary participation is further introduced. The analysis of the Q-table explains the mechanisms behind the cooperation evolution. Our findings indicate the fundamental role of environment information in the RL paradigm to understand the evolution of cooperation, and human behaviors in general.

摘要：Traditionally, the evolution of cooperation on structured population assumed the uniform interaction partner between gaming and learning. Yet in real-world society, individuals often act different roles in which environments gaming partners differ from learning partners. This investigation studies the evolution of cooperation under the effects of the diverse selection intensity induced by network asymmetry on two-layer networks, where the gaming and learning environments are modeled by different layers, respectively. It is found that heterogeneous selection intensity can alleviate the cooperation dilemma induced by asymmetry between gaming and learning environments. When selection intensity has a correlation with the edge overlap level of two layers, it is found that both positive correlation and negative correlation can optimize the evolution of cooperation for a moderate overlap level. However, positive correlation performs better than negative correlation in promoting the evolution of cooperation. Moreover, the increasing heterogeneity of selection enhances the evolution of cooperation under positive correlation, yet has different effects on cooperation under negative correlation for different temptations. Furthermore, we prove that the results are robust to the deterministic learning process as well as a higher noise.

摘要：The interaction between strategy and environment widely exists in nature and society. Traditionally, evolutionary dynamics in finite populations are described by the Moran process, where the environment is constant. Therefore, we model the Moran process with environmental feedbacks. Our results show that the selection intensity, which is closely related to the population size, exerts varying influences on evolutionary dynamics. In the case of the specific payoff matrix, cooperation cannot be favored by selection in extremely small-sized populations. The medium-sized populations are beneficial for the evolution of cooperation under intermediate selection intensities. For weak or strong selection intensities, the larger the population size, the more favorable it is for the evolution of cooperation. In the case of the generalized payoff matrix, the low incentives for the defector to cooperate in the degraded state cannot promote the emergence of cooperation. As the incentive for the defector to cooperate in the degraded state increases, selection favors cooperation or defection depending on the population size and selection intensity. For large values of the incentive for the defector facing the cooperative opponent to cooperate in the degraded state, selection always favors cooperation. We further investigate the impact of the time-scale on the fixation probability of cooperation.

摘要：We proposed a neighbor selection mechanism based on memory and target payoff, where the target payoff is the maximum value of the group’s average expected payoff. According to this mechanism, individuals prioritize selecting neighbors whose average payoffs in the last M rounds are close to the target payoff for strategy learning, aiming to maximize the group’s expected payoff. Simulation results on the grid-based Prisoner’s Dilemma and Snowdrift games demonstrate that this mechanism can significantly improve the group’s payoff and cooperation level. Furthermore, the longer the memory length, the higher the group’s payoff and cooperation level. Overall, the combination of memory and target payoff can lead to the emergence and persistence of cooperation in social dilemmas as individuals are motivated to cooperate based on both their past experiences and future goals. This interplay highlights the significance of taking into account numerous variables in comprehending and promoting cooperation within evolutionary frameworks.

摘要：In human societies and animal groups, individual behavior is often driven by self-interest, with actions typically avoided if they do not yield benefits. This paper focuses on payoff-related inertia, which describes the tendency of individuals to resist updating their strategies when faced with significant decreases in total payoffs compared to the last round. Through extensive simulations in both regular lattice and small-world networks, we find that individual inertia and its impact on cooperation evolves over time in Prisoner’s Dilemma game. At early stages, increased inertia due to decreased payoffs reduces transition probabilities between cooperators and defectors, preventing rapid collective shifts to defection and allowing the formation of cooperative clusters. As these clusters form, payoff-related inertia facilitates the transition of defectors to cooperators, promoting the expansion and stability of cooperative groups. Furthermore, we find that the introduction of payoff-related inertia enhances cooperation levels more significantly in small-world networks compared to regular lattice. Our study sheds light on the mechanisms that foster cooperation among self-interested individuals, contributing to a deeper understanding of cooperative behavior. By examining the dynamic interplay between strategy-updating inertia and evolutionary cooperation, we provide insights into the conditions that promote the emergence and stability of cooperation in social dilemmas.

摘要：Understanding the evolution of cooperation in multiplayer games is of vital significance for natural and social systems. An important challenge is that group interactions often leads to nonlinear synergistic effects. However, previous models mainly focus on deterministic nonlinearity where the arise of synergy or discounting effect is determined by certain conditions, ignoring uncertainty and stochasticity in real-world systems. Here, we develop a probabilistic framework to study the cooperative behavior in stochastic nonlinear public goods games. Through both analytical treatment and Monte Carlo simulations, we provide comprehensive understanding of social dilemmas with stochastic nonlinearity in both well-mixed and structured populations. We find that increasing the degree of nonlinearity makes synergy more advantageous when competing with discounting, thereby promoting cooperation. Interestingly, we show that network reciprocity loses effectiveness when the probability of synergy is small. Moreover, group size exhibits nonlinear effects on group cooperation regardless of the underlying structure. Our findings thus provide novel insights into how stochastic nonlinearity influences the emergence of prosocial behavior.

摘要：In this paper, we construct a nonlinear evolutionary game model to analyze the cooperation mechanisms of the population based on a nonlinear relationship among environment and strategies. In the model, replicator dynamics and aspiration dynamics are used to explore the evolutionary outcomes of collective decision, respectively. The results suggest that the environment tends to become progressively more affluent as the number of cooperators increases, if there is a smaller intensity of environmental destruction of defectors. Interestingly, the enriched environments may attract more defectors. Hence, the population requires a higher level of vigilance against plentiful environments in response to the emergence of defectors. As opposed to replicator dynamics, aspiration dynamics can avoid the persistent oscillatory loops due to the level of aspiration. Further, we investigate the effect of complexity between the population strategy and the environment on the evolutionary outcomes. It is found that higher level of complexity can drive the environment closer to a state of affluence, but the population's strategy structure will not be modified. These insights into the relationship between environment and strategies further our understanding of the evolutionary mechanism of population and society.

摘要：Corruption of third-party judges seriously undermines the level of cooperation. Without intervention, more corruptors and defectors would emerge, disrupting social harmony. Therefore, introducing an anti-corruption mechanism is crucial for the evolution of cooperation. In this paper, we propose a social monitoring mechanism to monitor third-party judges so that their payoffs are affected by the proportions of cooperators. Monte Carlo simulations on periodic boundary lattices. The results show that the social monitoring mechanism is effective in promoting cooperation and inhibiting corruption, and enhances the effectiveness of zealots in promoting cooperation. This facilitation effect is not only manifested in the Prisoner's Dilemma Game but also in the Snowdrift Game, which confirms the robustness of the results. Our research provides new insights for solving social dilemmas and curbing corruption.

摘要：Social exclusion is a powerful strategy in spatial public goods games for fostering cooperation, but it comes with costs and limitations. Inspired by the Broken Windows theory, connecting disorderly environments to community breakdown, we present two environmentally constrained cases. One case limits exclusion by dynamic exclusion probability, while the other faces constraints based on the dynamic unit cost of exclusion. Our analysis studies the evolutionarily stable state and phase transition processes under various parameter spaces for both cases. Results show that cooperation is promoted widely in both scenarios. Interestingly, when the unit cost of exclusion is dynamic, there is a notable expansion in the parameter space, leading to complete cooperation. Despite disorderly environments, both exclusion strategies effectively promote cooperation, with the dynamic cost strategy outperforming the dynamic exclusion probability strategy. These findings enhance our understanding of how environmental constraints and social exclusion shape prosocial behaviors.

摘要：Models of indirect reciprocity study how social norms promote cooperation. In these models, cooperative individuals build up a positive reputation, which in turn helps them in their future interactions. The exact reputational benefits of cooperation depend on the norm in place, which may change over time. Previous research focused on the stability of social norms. Much less is known about how social norms initially evolve when competing with many others. A comprehensive evolutionary analysis, however, has been difficult. Even among the comparably simple space of so-called third-order norms, there are thousands of possibilities, each one inducing its own reputation dynamics. To address this challenge, we use large-scale computer simulations. We studythe reputation dynamics ofeach third-order norm and all evolutionary transitions between them. In contrast to established work with only a handful of norms, we find that cooperation is hard to maintain in well-mixed populations. However, within group-structured populations, cooperation can emerge. The most successful norm in our simulations is particularly simple. It regards cooperation as universally positive, and defection as usually negative—unless defection takes the form ofjustified punishment. This research sheds light on the complex interplay of social norms, their induced reputation dynamics, and population structure.

摘要：Understanding the emergence of prosocial behaviours among self-interested individuals is an important problem in many scientific disciplines. Various mechanisms have been proposed to explain the evolution of such behaviours, primarily seeking the conditions under which a given mechanism can induce highest levels of cooperation. As these mechanisms usually involve costs that alter individual payoffs, it is however possible that aiming for highest levels of cooperation might be detrimental for social welfare -- the later broadly defined as the total population payoff, taking into account all costs involved for inducing increased prosocial behaviours. Herein, by comparatively analysing the social welfare and cooperation levels obtained from stochastic evolutionary models of two well-established mechanisms of prosocial behaviour, namely, peer and institutional incentives, we demonstrate exactly that. We show that the objectives of maximising cooperation levels and the objectives of maximising social welfare are often misaligned. We argue for the need of adopting social welfare as the main optimisation objective when designing and implementing evolutionary mechanisms for social and collective goods.

摘要：Propagation is crucial for acquiring information, and learning involves deep information processing. Imitation dynamics, commonly used in spatial public goods games, represents strategy propagation in society, while learning dynamics enables agents to self-learn through environmental interactions. In this paper, Q-learning and the Fermi update rule are used to compare differences between learning dynamics and imitation dynamics in simulation experiments. Our study finds that Q-learning is continuously updating the Q-table during its evolution, forming a heterogeneous gain matrix. However, Q-learning’s interaction with the environment is indirect, with almost no network reciprocity, and cannot form clusters in contrast to the Fermi update rule. The Fermi update rule focus only on immediate payoffs. Furthermore, we combine imitation dynamics and learning dynamics, integrating the advantages of both. Defectors and cooperators form a special semi-stable checkerboard-like state. The update rules, the number of states, and the configuration of conversion actions as strategies have led to this special structure. Moreover, we found that parameter choices in the new evolutionary dynamics affect the percentage of cooperation and evolutionary convergence. Overall, this paper offers new insights into learning dynamics and imitation dynamics and provides a foundation for integrating complex mechanisms of evolution.

摘要：In the real world, individuals are often involved in collaboration on multiple issues, and these issues may interact with each other. Given the complexity of the interaction, we establish a multi-issue repeated game model, in which individuals participate in multiple social dilemma games simultaneously and repeatedly, and strategies in different issue games are correlated and reactive. We explore the cooperation dynamics of strategies in the population from a multiobjective perspective, in which an individual's preference for each issue is described by a weight vector, and heterogeneous preferences of individuals in the population are also considered. Through simulations on two-issue games, we find that compared to the uncorrelated case, the correlated strategy can significantly promote cooperation in both games regardless of which issue players prefer. Under the condition of homogeneous preference, an increase in the payoff weight of a given issue decreases the level of cooperation in that issue, and the optimal condition to sustain cooperation to the maximum extent is when the payoff weights of all issues are equal. Moreover, under the condition of heterogeneous preference, there exists an optimal proportion of players with different preferences under which the cooperation rate can reach its highest level in the population. This work highlights individual trade-offs on different issues when engaging in multiple games simultaneously and further enriches the research of evolutionary games from a multiobjective and correlated strategy perspective.

摘要：This research investigates the impact of dynamic, time-varying interactions on cooperative behavior in social dilemmas. Traditional research has focused on deterministic rules governing pairwise interactions, yet the impact of interaction frequency and synchronization in groups on cooperation remains underexplored. Addressing this gap, our work introduces two temporal interaction mechanisms to model the stochastic or periodic participation of individuals in public goods games, acknowledging real-life variances due to exogenous temporal factors and geographical time differences. We consider that the interaction state significantly influences both game payoff calculations and the strategy updating process, offering new insights into the emergence and sustainability of cooperation. Our results indicate that maximum game participation frequency is suboptimal under a stochastic interaction mechanism. Instead, an intermediate activation probability maximizes cooperation, suggesting a vital balance between interaction frequency and inactivity security. Furthermore, local synchronization of interactions within specific areas is shown to be beneficial, as time differences hinder the spread of cross-structures but promote the formation of dense cooperative clusters with smoother boundaries. We also note that stronger clustering in networks, larger group sizes, and lower noise increase cooperation. This research contributes to understanding the role of node-based temporality and probabilistic interactions in social dilemmas, offering insights into fostering cooperation.
